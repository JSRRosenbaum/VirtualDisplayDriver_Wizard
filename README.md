What you see is what you get! Very simple prototype. Call it beta. 

I use this in my [workstation setup](http://sh.uni2.cc/28JLJ) was wondering how hard it would be to have a GUI for this and here we are.

Issues in advance:
- None that I am aware of at this time.
- OH WAIT UGLY -> UGLY UI is AN ISSUE! Whats up next? A GUI rework!

Things that work:
- User named backups feature
- installation/uninstallation/Reload of drivers.
- Pushing the configs to the C:\IddSampleDriver if not already there.
- Converting xml to text, text to xml
- Sorting your resolutions by priority levels. Moving entries with the same width and hight as a group.
- GPU Detection/Selection.
- Monitor Selection
- Reading and writing from the files.
- All core features work, if you find an issue you know where to report it!

Installing:
- The script/compiled executable should go in the folder where you store your [Virtual Display Drivers (Unpacked)](https://github.com/itsmikethetech/Virtual-Display-Driver), it will need access to them for installation purposes.
- Driver Installing depends on Microsoft DevCon as part of the [Windows Development Kit](https://download.microsoft.com/download/2/5/f/25f22c34-1cc4-404c-9f92-2ff26cc4ac91/KIT_BUNDLE_WDK_MEDIACREATION/wdksetup.exe) and here's a [FOSS based installer](https://github.com/Drawbackz/DevCon-Installer/releases/tag/1.3) for just devcon (update sources the version its offering may be dated, I did that before a Windows 11 Entry loaded. ALSO make sure to tick the Windows Path Variable option!)

Notes/Hints:
- At runtime it will load the vdd_settings.xml if present otherwise it will try to load adapter/option.txt. You can also replace/omit these accordingly at C:\IddSampleDriver if you want to workaround this very intended behavior.
- You can also place any config file with the script but in a folder "Backups" with the filename in the format "option.txt.[backup_title_here].backup", replace accordingly (vdd_settings.xml/option.txt/adapter.txt)
- You can name a backup whatever you like and place it manually and when you relaunch you can restore from it just as if you backed up from the GUI.
- What is Priority??? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, I made priority up to at least be able to force my preferred aspect ratio at the top of the list due to an issue with Immortals Fenyx Rising [HERE, look to the issues solutions segement and its what I was facing...](http://sh.uni2.cc/28JLJ)

TLDR: Installing... AGAIN
1. Unpack the script or exe, if you are using the script you will need [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) installed.
2. Unpack the [Virtual Display Drivers](https://github.com/itsmikethetech/Virtual-Display-Driver) into the same folder.
3. Install Devcon with [Windows Development Kit](https://download.microsoft.com/download/2/5/f/25f22c34-1cc4-404c-9f92-2ff26cc4ac91/KIT_BUNDLE_WDK_MEDIACREATION/wdksetup.exe) or [(this unofficial) DevCon-Installer](https://github.com/Drawbackz/DevCon-Installer/releases/tag/1.3).
4. Run the exe or script.
5. How to use it? Read the GUI.

This software is essentially in beta. This is a quick and dirty tool by design. There is always that chance to find an issue I missed. I will encourage you to let me know if you find any bugs, I can't fix what I don't know is broke!

Planned Features:
- A UI Theme/Overhaul.
